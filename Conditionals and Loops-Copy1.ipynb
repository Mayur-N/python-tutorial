    "In simple terms, a code block is a group of one or more lines of code that are meant to be executed together. These lines are grouped together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. In Python, code blocks are defined by their indentation level, meaning that they are set apart from the rest of the code by being indented (usually by 4 spaces or a tab).\n",

    "For example, all the statements inside above `if` statement forms a block of code. Unlike some other programming languages that use braces {} to define code blocks, Python uses **indentation**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line. In Python, indentation is not just for readability; it actually defines the **scope** of code blocks. All lines of code with the same amount of leading whitespace belong to the same block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
